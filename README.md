Deep Learning For Image Super resolution
Abstract: Image super-resolution is an important area of computer vision that aims to enhance the resolution of images and videos. Deep learning has been widely used for image super-resolution, and in this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in this field. Our project focuses on implementing different image super-resolution models using artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) in both time/spatial and frequency domains. We also plan to conduct a comparative study of the performance of different deep learning models.

Introduction: This project aims to address the problem of image super-resolution using deep learning. Image super-resolution is a technique used to enhance the resolution of images and videos. This is important in computer vision applications, where images and videos with higher resolution can provide more detailed information. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for image super-resolution, and this project focuses on exploring the latest advances in this field. We aim to implement different image super-resolution models using ANN/CNN in both time/spatial and frequency domains. We will also conduct a comparative study of these models to evaluate their performance.

Methodology: Our project will involve implementing different image super-resolution models using deep learning techniques. We will use ANN/CNN to train our models in both time/spatial and frequency domains. We will experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to optimize the performance of our models. We will evaluate the performance of our models by comparing them to existing state-of-the-art methods for image super-resolution.

Results: We expect our project to yield significant insights into the performance of different deep learning models for image super-resolution. By comparing the performance of our models to existing methods, we hope to identify areas for improvement and suggest new directions for future research. Our project will also provide a platform for further research in this field and contribute to the development of more effective image super-resolution techniques.

Conclusion: Image super-resolution is an important area of computer vision that has seen significant advances in recent years. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for image super-resolution, and this project aims to explore the latest advances in this field. By implementing different image super-resolution models using deep learning techniques, we hope to provide a comprehensive survey of the performance of these models. We believe that our project will contribute to the development of more effective image super-resolution techniques and provide a platform for further research in this field.
